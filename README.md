# Invenio SQLAlchemy Training

This repository contains training material for Invenio SQLAlchemy.

## Usage

To present this interactive training, you'll need to setup the following "layout" in
your VS Code (or other editor that supports similar features):

![](./layout.png)

Afterwards you just go through the numbered tabs in order, present the slides and
for for each left/right code pane, ask participants the questions marked with ❓.

## TODO

- [ ] Add excercise solutions
- [ ] Consider reversing excercises from Python/SQLAlchemy -> SQL, to SQL ->
  Python/SQLAlchemy (since most folks are more familiar with Python than SQL)
