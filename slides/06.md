# The life and death of engines, sessions, and transactions

- **Engine**: Connection to the DB. Created once, used throughout the app.
- **Session**:
  - The Unit of Work in SQLAlchemy
  - Managing transactions and identity maps
  - Encapsulates a "logical" operation in the application
- **Transaction**: Understanding `begin`, `commit`, â€” where and how these fit into the flow.
