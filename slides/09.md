### Common Pitfalls and WTFs

- **N+1 Query Problem**: Lazy loading can hurt performance
  - ðŸ‘‰ Use `.join()`, `joinedload`, `selectinload`
- **Overfetching**: Fetching more data than you need by accident
  - ðŸ‘‰ Use `.limit()`, specify columns in `.query()`
- **Know thy SQL**: SQLAlchemy is not a black box, know what SQL is being generated
  - ðŸ‘‰ Set `SQLALCHEMY_ECHO` to see what SQL is being produced/sent.
- **Profiling**: Only real data can tell you where your bottlenecks are
  - ðŸ‘‰ Set `SQLALCHEMY_RECORD_QUERIES` (or SQLTap) for profiling.
