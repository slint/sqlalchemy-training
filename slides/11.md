### Bonus: The Journey from v1 -> v2, and why you should care

Whatâ€™s new in SQLAlchemy v2.x:
- `select()` and `where()` replacing old-style queries; explicit is better than implicit.
- Changes to session usage patterns
  - Building and executing queries are clearly separated
- No more `dynamic` relationships.
